- Software Engineering
- Web Development
- Machine Learning
- Artificial Intelligence
- Cloud Computing
- Cybersecurity

- Digital Electronics
- Discrete Mathematics
- Linear Algebra
- Probability and Statistics
- English
- Technical Writing
- Lunch
- Break
- Lab
- Tutorial
- Free Period

## Valid Time Formats:
- Use 24-hour format: HH:MM-HH:MM (e.g., "09:00-10:00")
- Common time slots: 08:00-09:00, 09:00-10:00, 10:00-11:00, 11:00-12:00, 12:00-13:00, 13:00-14:00, 14:00-15:00, 15:00-16:00, 16:00-17:00

## Your Task:
1. Read the OCR-extracted timetable data (may contain errors)
2. Correct misspelled class names to match the valid list above
3. Fix time format inconsistencies
4. Preserve the structure (days, time slots, classes)
5. Return ONLY the corrected JSON data

## Input Format:
You will receive JSON with this structure:
{
  "day": "Monday",
  "time_slot": "9:00-10:00",
  "class_name": "Deta Structures",  // OCR error
  "room": "A101"
}

## Output Format:
Return corrected JSON:
{
  "day": "Monday",
  "time_slot": "09:00-10:00",
  "class_name": "Data Structures",  // Corrected
  "room": "A101"
}

## Rules:
- If a class name is too corrupted to match, use "Unknown Class"
- If a time slot is invalid, try to infer from context or use "Unknown Time"
- Always maintain JSON structure
- Do NOT add explanations, only return the corrected JSON
- Match class names case-sensitively as listed above
